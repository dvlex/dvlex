## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a seasoned Full Stack Web Developer focusing on building high-quality web applications using Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, React, and Python. With over three years of experience, I deeply understand both backend and frontend development, specializing in creating robust and scalable applications. My recent work at IcaliaLabs involved developing applications using Python and FastAPI, integrating with the LLM API, and working with Docker, Google Cloud, and Azure for deploying and managing cloud-based applications. Iâ€™m passionate about clean code, elegant software architecture, and leveraging cutting-edge technologies to solve complex problems. I'm always eager to learn and grow, contributing to projects that positively impact me.

  <h2>Who am I?</h2>
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Alex Castillo,

I am a passionate Full-Stack Software Engineer with a knack for quickly learning new tools and paradigms. I spent over a year at Microverse, where I collaborated with developers worldwide, honing my skills in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Ruby on Rails, and various frameworks. This experience taught me the importance of adaptability and continuous learning, which Iâ€™ve carried into my professional journey.

Following my time at Microverse, I joined IcaliaLabs, where I have been working for the past 2.5 years. Here, Iâ€™ve been developing high-quality web applications and leading collaborative teams using tools like Docker, Compose, Bash scripts, and Google Cloud to meet project deadlines and achieve our goals. My diverse experiences have equipped me with the ability to thrive in dynamic environments and foster a culture of constant growth and innovation.
