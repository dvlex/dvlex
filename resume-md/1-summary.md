Seasoned Full Stack Web Developer specializing in Ruby and Ruby on Rails, with a proven track record in delivering high-quality web applications. My recent tenure at IcaliaLabs has been instrumental in enhancing my expertise and skill set. Armed with a strong command of JavaScript, React, Redux, and a broad range of development tools and methodologies, I bring a comprehensive approach to software development.

My proficiency in Ruby and Ruby on Rails enabled the development of web projects with efficiency and precision, often in collaboration with Tailwind CSS and Hotwire frameworks.

Furthermore, my experience with Docker, deploying applications via Cloud Run, and effectively utilizing remote containers has streamlined development processes. My contributions to developing RESTful APIs, implementing Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, and deploying projects on Google Cloud Platform have sharpened my skills in software architecture, problem-solving, and remote collaboration.

With a strong focus on delivering elegant, scalable, and maintainable code, I am well-equipped to make significant contributions as a Full Stack Web Developer.
